# transaction-receipt-relayer

This repository contains an Ethereum transaction receipt relayer for the GGX network.
The relayer verifies finalized blocks using [Helios light client](https://github.com/a16z/helios).
The relayer requires a Beacon and Consensus RPC node, which updates and blocks will be verified.
It will relay transaction receipts for the smart contracts list managed by the pallet in this repository.
